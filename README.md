# FutbolStars
This project is a basic football webpage that contains information about football teams through direct links to their official websites, as well as the option to purchase accessories and clothing from various teams through the FutbolEmotion store.

## Description
The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes basic features such as direct links to the official websites of the clubs featured on the page, a menu section where users can access the clothing store, accessories, and a news section. It also includes a support section where you can contact the company for help via email or phone call. Additionally, there is a section showing the location of the physical store, and at the end of the header, there is a direct link to the inspiration page. The website also includes decorative elements, such as photos in the lower corners.

## Installation and Usage
To run the page, a Visual Studio extension was used. By right-clicking on the .html file and selecting “Open with Live Server,” the page is launched in a web browser (Live Server).
##Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my classmates Juan Pablo Miguel Velázquez and Ivan Brito Pérez, as they were a great help when working on the CSS, which I had some trouble with.
